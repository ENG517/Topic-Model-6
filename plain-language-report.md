## Plain Language Report

In editing for plain language, the most significant and common aspects that were edited in the repository involved restrictive references, consistent organizing, and consistent term usage.

To ensure consistent term usage, we relied on the uicontrol element often. In [tasks/t_share_screen.dita], we had to edit a command using the paramedic method to get to the action and eliminate unnecessary wordiness, and to consistently use company term's. See also our (pull request)[https://github.com/ENG517/Topic-Model-6/pull/8/commits/632c1818c7cdb0a2aafa8c48811855df9a5f3524] for the context of the edit.

Original:
> <cmd>Click the button in the upper-right corner of the screen showing an upward facing arrow inside a square.</cmd>

Edited:
> <cmd>Click the <uicontrol>Share</uicontrol> button to open the screen-sharing menu.</cmd>

This edit also fixed a restrictive reference, as the command identified the location of the Share button as being in the upper-right corner of the screen, which may not be the case on mobile, Mac/PC, or on the web version of Teams.

Organizing files with topic sections was not consistently utilized in the repository until this round of editing.
Going through, we made sure to keep only 1 paragraph in the p element and to break up large sections of text. The concept topics were the usual suspects for large blocks of text with little-to-no organization.

In [concepts/c_Speaker_Coach.dita], there were a number of organizing issues that has to be resolved, which included separating paragraphs with sections and separate topic titles. See the (pull request)[https://github.com/ENG517/Topic-Model-6/pull/9/files] for more context regarding the edits.
