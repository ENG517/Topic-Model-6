# Reflection  
## Opening, Summary of Model
This is a memo for Group 6’s (mini) Topic Modeling assignment for ENG 512\. Beth and I focused on her original user scenarios and work, which dealt with various topics with Microsoft PowerPoint’s Speaker Coach tool and sharing a screen during a Teams meeting. Expanding on both of those topics turned this model into a broader exploration of Microsoft Office Suite tools, specifically Teams screen sharing and PowerPoint’s Speaker Coach tools. Teams can work with both screen sharing and the Speaker Coach tool. Based on Beth’s original user scenarios, the tasks and DITA maps can be oriented towards a novice and expert audience.

## User Scenarios 
### User Scenario 1  
User Scenario 1 involves an IT trainer (experienced user) who will use Speaker Coach to improve their presentation skills. They would be interested in using the tool because they are limited on time to practice with another person. The trainer is familiar with the computer and software. They are utilizing the feedback from Speaker Coach to help improve their delivery of training materials to other employees. 

The user in this scenario works in an office setting with little distractions and requires a basic knowledge of developing slide decks in PowerPoint. Users are willing to practice and receive feedback to improve their skills and teaching.

### User Scenario 2   
This scenario is based on students enrolled in a public speaking course who will use Speaker Coach during the semester to improve their presentation skills. In Beth’s scenario, the students will apply their rehearsal notes to their presentations during a synchronous virtual session. 

Students are comfortable with basic technology, PowerPoint, and Speaker Coach, although they are likely to be unfamiliar with the tool located in PowerPoint. Users will need a basic knowledge of technology, such as how to permit access to their computer microphone, camera, and screen, which is a requirement for receiving the most effective feedback from Speaker Coach.

## Outline of DITA Maps
Group 6 has three DITA maps, one for the Speaker Coach topics that is oriented toward either audience. [Expert Speaker Coach](Expert_Speaker_Coach.ditamap) and [Student Speaker Coach](Student_Speaker_Caoch.ditamap) are oriented towards users with different skill levels, but the organization schema of the maps speak more to the needs of their specific users. 

[Novice Teams Screen Sharing](Novice_Teams_Screen_Sharing.ditamap) is meant to act as a sub-map for the other user scenarios, since as mentioned above, this inclusion expands on Beth’s original work while connecting the software of Microsoft Office Suite.

[Expert Speaker Coach](Expert_Speaker_Coach.ditamap) begins with the task topic of using Speaker Coach, which is the parent topic for the rest of the related topics, besides the Teams sub-map. The child topics include a concept for Speaker Coach, references for the feedback for different versions of the software, references for the definitions in the rehearsal report, and references for best uses of Speaker Coach, in that order. This map speaks to the experts who are already familiar with the software and need to complete a task immediately, or refresh on the basics so as to best serve their students.

[Student Speaker Coach](Student_Speaker_Caoch.ditamap) begins with a concept describing Speaker Coach and goes into the references, ending with the task of using Speaker Coach. This outline works best for students who would be unfamiliar with the software and need to know the references and concept as background information to complete their task, or to read to learn to do, whereas the ‘expert’ audience is likely reading to do.
